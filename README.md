# Live-Project

## About
For the last two weeks while at The Tech Academy, I worked with a team of colleges on developing a full scale MVC/MVVM Web Application in C#. This project was a great leaning experience that allowed me to create code, fix bugs, clean up previous code, and add multiple features to the project. I worked on several back end stories like creating a modal for people to submit photos, creating different background templates that the user could switch between, and creating a form for people to change email information. Everyone in the team was able to work on both front and back end stories and was able to get skills that will help them all in the future!
